   - Include 2  recommended resources (articles, books, videos, exercises)
   -create a challenge that reinforce weeks learning.  
4. Make the output actionable and motivating.

based on the learning plan created, generate a template that the user can copy into their google docs 
the text should be a table with columns as : week, goal, resource, challenge, done
