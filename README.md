## Overview

**Learning Ladder AI** is an AI-powered learning goal planner that helps users break down ambitious learning goals into structured, achievable plans. Whether you're starting a new subject or upskilling for your career, Learning Ladder AI acts as your intelligent assistant â€” organizing your journey step-by-step.

Built using [Langflow](https://docs.langflow.org/) and GroqAI, this no-code MVP demonstrates how dynamic AI agents can support goal-setting, planning, and resource discovery â€” all through natural language.

## What Has Been Done So Far

- Developed a clean, responsive Streamlit UI for users to input:
  - Learning Topic (goal)
  - Preferred Duration
  - Experience Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Integration with an AI backend via REST API (using environment variables for secure token and endpoint handling)
- Generated learning plans returned and displayed with:
  - An Overview table (desktop only, with scroll on mobile)
  - A weekly plan breakdown, optimized for readability across devices
- Custom styling for buttons and layout to enhance UX without excess complexity
- Error handling for API responses and JSON parsing issues
- Responsive design considerations including:
  - Hiding large tables on small screens with scrollbars to prevent overflow
  - Simplified and minimal CSS to keep the app lightweight and fast

## Key Features

- Breaks learning goals into weekly milestones
- Recommends curated learning resources
- (Future) Calendar or reminder integration
- Context-aware, memory-driven conversations
- Built with Responsible AI guardrails
